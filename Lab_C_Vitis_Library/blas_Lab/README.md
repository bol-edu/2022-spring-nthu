# Vitis BLAS Library
Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS) is a specification that prescribes a set of low-level routines for performing common linear algebra operations such as vector addition, scalar multiplication, dot products, linear combinations, and matrix multiplication. 

Although the BLAS specification is general, BLAS implementations are often optimized for speed on a particular machine, so using them can bring substantial performance benefits. BLAS implementations will take advantage of special floating point hardware such as vector registers or SIMD instructions.

As a result, Xilinx offers Vitis BLAS Library as a fast FPGA-accelerated implementation of the standard basic linear algebra subroutines which provides us the end-to-end (E2E) application acceleration.
