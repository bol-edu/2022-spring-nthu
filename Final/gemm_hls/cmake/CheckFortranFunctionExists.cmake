# CheckFortranFunctionExists
# --------------------------
#
# macro which checks if the Fortran function exists
#
# CHECK_FORTRAN_FUNCTION_EXISTS(FUNCTION VARIABLE)
#
# ::
#
#   FUNCTION - the name of the Fortran function
#   VARIABLE - variable to store the result
#              Will be created as an internal cache variable.
#
#
#
# The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
# the way the check is run:
#
# ::
#
#   CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link
